# Dashboard-for-Sales


This was the first dashboard I created using Power BI, focusing on the sales and profits of an American company.
The key performance indicators included:
Total sales
Profits
Quantities sold
Total number of customers
We also analyzed sales across different states, and found that New York City had the highest sales volume.
In terms of product categories, Technology was the top-selling category, followed by Home Furniture.
The dashboard also includes a report on the most loyal customers, with Sean Miller ranking at the top of the list.

Finally, the largest quantities sold were in the Office Supplies category
